 <p>I'm a part time student at BMCC aspiring to become a graphic designer. My major is Multimedia
Programming and Design at Borough of Manhattan Community College. My dream is to one
day get a degree and obtain a job in graphic design where I can use my skills to design
something creative and interesting.
